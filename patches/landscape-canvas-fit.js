/**
 * Patch: landscape-canvas-fit.js
 *
 * Fixes the game canvas in landscape: ensures it is height-fitted and
 * horizontally centered (black bars on sides), matching PokeRogue's layout.
 *
 * Root cause:
 *   Phaser Scale.FIT + CENTER_BOTH centers the canvas within its parent (#app).
 *   In landscape, #app has no explicit width or centering — it is a left-aligned
 *   block element. Phaser correctly sizes the canvas to fit the screen HEIGHT
 *   (phones are ~2.17:1, game is 1.78:1, so height-fit produces black bars),
 *   but places the canvas at x=0 within #app. The result: the canvas is flush
 *   to the left edge with a black bar only on the right, and the left portion
 *   of the game content appears cut off or mis-centered.
 *
 *   Additionally, the notch-fix patch adds body { padding-top: safe-area-inset-top }.
 *   In landscape the notch inset moves to the sides — inset-top is 0 or near-0 —
 *   but any non-zero value shifts the canvas down and clips the bottom.
 *
 * Fix:
 *   In landscape only:
 *   1. Reset body padding-top to 0 (notch inset is on sides, not top, in landscape)
 *   2. Make body a flex container that centers #app horizontally
 *   3. No width/height constraints on #app — let Phaser measure naturally
 *
 *   Phaser reads window dimensions, computes height-fit scale, sizes canvas to
 *   e.g. 698x393px, and centers it within #app. Body flex centers #app (and
 *   therefore the canvas) within the full viewport width. Black bars appear
 *   naturally on both sides. Controls sit in those bars. Portrait unchanged.
 *
 * Targets: pokevoid-src/dist/index.html

     * Fix: make body a flex container that centers #app horizontally.
     * Also reset padding-top to 0 — the notch inset is on the sides in landscape.
     * No size constraints are applied so Phaser's natural measurement is unaffected.
