/**
 * Patch: notch-fix.js
 *
 * Fixes content rendering under the status bar on iOS and Android.
 *
 * Root cause:
 *   - pokevoid's index.html already has viewport-fit=cover, so
 *     env(safe-area-inset-*) variables are non-zero on iOS. Good.
 *   - However nothing in the CSS uses env(safe-area-inset-top) to
 *     actually push the canvas below the status bar.
 *   - On Android 15+, edge-to-edge is enforced by default, meaning
 *     the WebView draws behind the status bar regardless of orientation.
 *   - On iOS, "contentInset": "never" was removed from capacitor.config
 *     in build.yml so the WebView respects safe areas.
 *
 * Fix:
 *   Inject a <style> block that applies padding-top: env(safe-area-inset-top)
 *   to body universally. This works for both iOS (portrait notch) and Android
 *   (status bar in landscape). env(safe-area-inset-top) returns 0 when there
 *   is no status bar, so it's safe to apply unconditionally.
 *
 * Targets: pokevoid-src/dist/index.html

     *   iOS:     viewport-fit=cover is set (already done in index.html)
     *   Android: Capacitor exposes window insets to the WebView
     *
     * It returns 0 when there is no status bar overlap, so applying
     * it unconditionally is safe — no visible effect on desktop/web.
     *
     * Portrait:  status bar is at the top — padding pushes canvas down.
     * Landscape: on most devices the status bar is hidden or very thin
     *            so env(safe-area-inset-top) will be 0 or negligible.
     *            We still apply it to handle edge cases (e.g. Android
     *            devices that show the status bar in landscape).
